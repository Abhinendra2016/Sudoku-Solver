# Sudoku Puzzle Solver

This project is a Sudoku puzzle solver built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Sudoku Puzzle Solver is a web application that allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and solve it with the click of a button. The puzzle is displayed in a 9x9 grid, and users can input the initial values of the puzzle. The solver algorithm then computes and fills in the solution for the puzzle.

## Repository

The project repository is hosted on GitHub at [Sudoku Solver Repository](https://github.com/Abhinendra2016/Sudoku-Solver.git).

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the Sudoku puzzle solver.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the puzzle grid and the solve button.
- `sudoku.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the Sudoku solver algorithm and handles user interactions.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku Puzzle Solver, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Input the initial values of the Sudoku puzzle in the grid. Click the "Solve Puzzle" button, and the solver algorithm will fill in the solution for the puzzle.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Generation**: The 9x9 Sudoku grid is dynamically generated using JavaScript.
